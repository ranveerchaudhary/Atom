## The Engine :gear:

### 1. Code :computer:</a>
<p align = "justify">The main forces behind Atom are vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript with :sunny: custom animated weather widgets (courtesy to <a href = "https://bas.dev/">Bas</a>). HTML is a versatile language that can be used to create a wide range of different web pages, from simple static pages to complex interactive web applications. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, and there are many resources available online to help beginners get started with HTML.  CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML (or XML) documents. In other words, while HTML is used to define the structure and content of a web page, CSS is used to define how that content should be displayed. JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is primarily used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It is often referred to as a client-side language because it is executed on the client's web browser rather than on the web server.</p>

### 2. Frameworks :mechanical_arm: 

<p align = "justify">In addition to the popular trio, Atom also incorporates JQuery as a lightweight and versatile JavaScript library designed to simplify web development tasks. With its intuitive syntax and extensive collection of ready-to-use functions, jQuery empowers developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages effortlessly. Whether it's handling event-driven actions, manipulating HTML elements, or making asynchronous requests, JQuery streamlines the process and enhances the overall efficiency of web development projects. Its widespread adoption and extensive documentation make it a popular choice among developers for building modern and engaging websites.</p>
